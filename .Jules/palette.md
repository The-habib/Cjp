## 2026-07-09 - Added missing ARIA labels to mobile navigation

**Learning:** Found an accessibility issue pattern specific to this app's components: icon-only mobile navigation buttons (bottom nav and floating action button) lacked `aria-label`s, making them unreadable by screen readers.
**Action:** Always ensure icon-only buttons have descriptive `aria-label` attributes, especially in recurring layout components like navigation bars.
